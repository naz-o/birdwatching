# birdwatching
Automatic Birdwatching Project i did with a few of my Friends.
Slap this project on a RaspberryPi, connect a DHT22 or similiar (GPIO2), a Active Buzzer (Optional)(GPIO17), a PIR Sensor (GPIO18) and a Raspberrypi Camera to the Raspberrypi.
Leave it on where you want to it to watch birds, and run stuff.py.
To activate the Web Interface go to /project/ and run "sudo python3 manage.py runserver 0:8080 &".
